# PlaydateUI

A lua based ui framework for playdate inspired by SwiftUI. 

This repo is an example project & the library mixed together. 
PlaydateUI requires a C library in order to operate, simplifying the process of installing is a future goal. 

## Build
Follow the clion/cmake setup directions from the playdate dev docs. 
I've only built this project with a clion on macOS, I am not sure if it works on other platforms. 

### This library is under heavy evolution
Building a ui framework is an iterative process, as is designing apis to be ergonomic. Everything here is subject to change. 

## Examples
